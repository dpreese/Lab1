  <h3>The Best Photographers!</h3>
    <div class="review">
      <p>Reese and Ruby are real artist! We love their flow and how natural it feels when they're taking our picture, its not awkward at all! Even my distracted 9 month old and full of energy six year old were captivated by her energy. We were able to capture some real qenuine moments! I have NEVER written a positive review but her work is worth every letter!!
        She spent so much time helping me coordinate clothes (because I totally suck at it)
        I have found our families photographer for everything! Ill never go to anyone else again!
        Seriously will not regret capturing your families moments with R&R!

  <h3>Professional and Quality Photographers</h3>
    <div class="review">
      <p>I sat on the fence for so long and when I saw R&R's work I knew I wanted to book a session with them! I  absolutely loved the photos they captured. They spent so much time and energy on my session and even after. They were so patient with me trying to figure out what I wanted. They made me feel comfortable and beautiful and I couldnâ€™t thank them and their makeup team enough for giving me this experience I will never forget. If you are looking for great photographers, I highly recommend them! I want to do more! :)
